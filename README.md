>- Step 2: Use your left hand to open the toothpaste
> 
> 
>- Step 3: Take the toothbrush in your left hand

## 2 Two KATAS

### 2.1 Fahrenheit-to-celcius converter 🌡️
Use TDD to create a fahrenheit-to-celcius converter.

> See the method `fahrenheitToCeliusConverter(double fahrenheit)` in the class-file: `src/FahrenheitCelciusConverter.java`
> 
> See all the tests in the class-file: `test/FahrenheitToCelciusConverterTest.java`

Use TDD to extend it to a celcius-to-fahrenheit converter.

> See the method `celciusToFahrenheit(double celcius)` in the class-file: `src/FahrenheitCelciusConverter.java`
>
> See all the tests in the class-file: `test/CelciusToFahrenheitConverterTest.java`


### 2.2 Roman Numeral Kata 🔢
Implement an "Arabic numeral to Roman numeral" converter using TDD.

> See the method `convertToRoman(int i)` in the class-file: `src/RomanNumeralConverter.java`
>
> See the all the tests in the class-file: `test/RomanNumeralTest.java`


## 3 Give Your Thoughts on TDD 

---

>**What was positive and good about using TDD?**
> 
>I can be sure that my methods are working as intended because of the tests I made before the implementation of the code.

>**What was annoying or difficult?**
> 
>I need to use some time to think of the method I need to implement before actually implementing it. It can be difficult sometimes to know what I need to test before having and looking at the code.

>**What surprised you?**
> 
>I was surprised that I was easier to make the code for my method after I made the tests.

>**Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldn’t otherwise have thought of?**
> 
>Yes I think so. I was thinking more about the different scenarios if certain inputs were given a certain method. For example, the illegal inputs that I needed to test for the converter methods.
